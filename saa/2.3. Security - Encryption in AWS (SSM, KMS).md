# Encryption in AWS

- ![Encryption in AWS](img/encryption/encryption-in-aws.png)

## Encryption key

- Two solutions currently exist for managing encryption keys:
  - **Hardware security modules (HSM)**
    - HSM = Hardware security module
      - Lose the keys => no way to recover
  - **Key management services (KMS)**
    - Also known as a cryptographic key management service (CKMS)

### AWS KMS - Key Management Service

    - **Rotation policies** e.g. key must be changed ever year
- **Monitoring**: Audit key usage using CloudTrail
- Integrates with e.g. EBS (volumes), S3 (SSE), Redshift, RDS and SSM.

- üí° Managed KMS key per service is created for AWS services e.g. one for CodeCommit, one for RDS, one for S3, one for Lambda...

- **Customer Master Keys (CMKs)**

    | Type | Can view | Can manage | Account-specific | Price |
    | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------------------- | -- |
    | Customer managed CMK | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |  Monthly fee key + usage |
    | AWS managed CMK | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ùå | Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è | No monthly fee, just usage |
    | AWS owned CMK | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Free |
  - ‚ùó The value in KMS is that the* CMK (Customer Master Key)* used to encrypt data can never be retrieved by the user.

- Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
  - E.g. lambda environment variables.

- KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
- ‚ùó KMS can only encrypt up to 4KB of data per call
  - üìù If data > 4 KB, use envelope encryption
  - Envelope encryption = Encrypt your key (data key) using master key.
- To give access to KMS to someone
  - Make sure the Key Policy allows the user
  - Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls
- **Flow**
  - ***Encrypt API***: *KMS* checks IAM permissions & performs encryption & sends encrypted secret
  - ***Decrypt API***: *KMS* check IAM permissions & performs decryption & sends decrypted secrets (in plain-text)

### AWS Systems Manager - Systems Manager Parameter Store

- Secure storage for configuration and secrets
- (*Optional*) Seamless Encryption using KMS
  - Requires KMS policy to be activated

- Configuration management using path & IAM
  - üí° Best practice to give IAM role for reading only the needed parameter
  - For plain text configurations it's enough to give SSM read permission
    - For decrypted parameters, you also need to give IAM permission to KMS.

- Flow:
  - *Application* sends encrypted configuration to *SSM Parameter Store*
  - *SSM Parameter Store* checks IAM permissions
  - *SSM Parameter Store* decrypts configuration using AWS KMS
  - *Application* receives plain-text configuration from *SSM Parameter Store*.
- Configurations are retrieved using `GetParameters` or `GetParametersByPath` API.

## Encryption types

- **Encryption in flight (SSL)**
  - Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
  - SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS = SSL enabled)
  - ***Flow***
    - You send data SSL encrypted with key and over HTTPS
    - Server (HTTPS website) decrypts data with SSL key.
    
- **Server side encryption at rest**
  - Encryption/decryption is handled by server-side
    - Data is encrypted after being received by the server
    - Data is decrypted before being sent
  - It's stored in a encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a ***data key***)
  - The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it.
    - Usually stored in KMS (Key Management Service)
  
- **Client side encryption**
  - Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
  - Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
  
  - üìùCould leverage ***Envelope Encryption***
    - You encrypt encryption key with **Envelope Key** in KMS.
    - You manage encryption key, AWS manages Envelope Key.
