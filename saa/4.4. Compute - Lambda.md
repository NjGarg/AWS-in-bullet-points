# AWS Lambda

## Serverless introduction

- In AWS: Lambda & Step Functions, DynamoDB, AWS Cognito, AWS API Gateway, S3, SNS & SQS, Kinesis, Aurora Serverless...
- Serverless application examples:
  - Users *->* Rest API *->* API Gateway *->* Lambda *->* DynamoDB with log in function from Amazon Cognito.
  - Serverless thumbnail creation
    - User uploads image to S3
    - S3 triggers lambda function to create a thumbnail
    - Lambda
      - Creates & pushes thumbnail image into S3
      - Saves metadata in DynamoDB

## Lambda

- **Pricing**
    1. Pay per **calls**.
    2. Pay per **duration** (in increment of 100ms)
         - E.g. you get 400.000 GBs of FREE compute time
           - = 400.000 seconds if function is 1 GB RAM
           - = 3.200.000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
- **Integrations**
  - Almost whole AWS Stack can trigger it: API Gateway, Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3, AWS IoT, CloudWatch Events, CloudWatch Logs, AWS SNS, AWS Cognito, Amazon SQS and more.
- **Lambda@Edge** lets you run lambda functions in edge locations.
- ***Blueprint***s are code templates for writing Lambda functions.
- You can test lambdas directly on portal by configuring & sending ***test event***s in the Console
- **Security**
  - ***IAM role*** must be attached to it.
  - Deployed within a **VPC** as default.
    - To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC:
      - Give subnet IDs and security group IDs
      - Lambda uses those IDs to set up ENIs.
    - AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC.
    - ðŸ’¡ In your subnet you need enough available IP / ENI's otherwise you get `EC2ThrottledException` for concurrent execution.
  - Lambda can have **Security Groups**.
  - Auditing and compliance through ***CloudTrail*** logging.
- **Configurations**
    - Function fails directly after timeout
    - Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!
  - **DTQ**: Debugging and error handling through dead letter queues (can be SQS or SNS)
- ðŸ’¡ Architectures can get complicated -> AWS X-ray allows you to debug what's happening.
   
  - **Execution**
    - **Memory allocation**: 128 MB - 3008 MB (64 MB increments)
    - **Maximum execution time**: Default 3 seconds and MAX 15 minutes
    - **Disk capacity** in the "function container" (in `/tmp`): 512 MB
    - **Concurrency limits**: 1000 (soft limit)
    - **Size of environment variables**: 4 KB
