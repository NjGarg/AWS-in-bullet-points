# EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- **Pricing**
  - Billed only when in `running` state.
    - And `stopping` state only if it's hibernating.
  - **Data transfer costs**
    - Free between EC2 and other services.
    - Free between EC2 instances in same availability zone using private IP addresses only.
    - $0.01/GB for transfer between instances in different availability zones
- **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**
  - Each ENI can optionally have one **Elastic IP** (static IP).
  - You can attach a network interface to an EC2 instance in the following ways:
    - **Hot attach**: When it's running
    - **Warm attach**: When it's stopped
    - **Cold attach**: When the instance is being launched
  - Termination with instance termination
    - Default interfaces are terminated with instance termination.
    - Manually added interfaces are not terminated by default
- **Status Checks** checks physical machine (underlying hyper-visor) and returns pass & fail.
  - You can set-up **Status Checks** alarms.
- **EC2 Instance Metadata**
  - Allows AWS EC2 instances to learn about themselves without using an IAM Role / permission.
  - The internal URLs are accessible only by EC2
  - You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata
    - ‚ùó You can not retrieve the IAM policy
  - ***Meta data*** = Info about the EC2 instance at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
    - Your EC2 instance has always credentials to the role that usually expires in 1 hour
      - Get IAM credentials: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<iam-role-name>`
  - ***User data*** = launch script of the EC2 instance `http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data`
  
- **Enhanced Networking** can be enabled on specific instances with a driver to reduce networking overhead + faster networking.
  - üìùSingle root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV)
  - Utilizes Elastic Network Adapter (high Performance Network Interface for Amazon EC2)
  - Free
  - ‚ùó Limitations
    - Instances must be launched in a VPC
    - Instances must be launched from a HVM AMI
- **Monitoring**
  - ‚ùóüìù CloudWatch does not monitor memory usage as well as disk space utilization
    - üí° Requires installation of CloudWatch agent or use custom scripts to send custom metrics.
- **Launch templates**
  - Store launch parameters so that you don't specify them every time you launch an instance.
  - E.g. AMI ID, instance type, key pairs and Security Groups.t
- üí° An instance may immediately terminate if:
  - You've reached your EBS volume limit
  - An EBS snapshot is corrupt
  - The root EBS volume is encrypted and you do not have permissions to access the KMS key for decryption
  - The instance store-backed AMI that you is missing a required part (an image.part.xx file)

## Basic tasks

- **Hibernating** an instance means persisting all of its data and RAM so you can pre-warm an instance before resuming.
- **Stopping and starting** an instance migrate EC2 to a most likely new underlying host.
- **Retiring**: An instance is scheduled to be **retired** when AWS detects irreparable failure of the underlying hardware hosting the instance.
  - When an instance reaches its scheduled retirement date
    - It is stopped (if it has EBS root volume) or
    - Terminated (if it has instance instance store root volume) by AWS
- **üìùGet meta data**
  - Request to EC2 metadata service from your EC2 instance
    - `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
    - It returns the properties (recursively)
    - Get data further e.g. `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone`
  - You can also use `Instance Metadata Query Tool` which is a simple bash script that does the curl.

- **Connect to EC2 through SSH**
  - SSH with e.g. `ssh -i privatekey.pem <user-name>@<ip-address>`
    - Username can be `ec2-user` (Amazon Linux, RHEL, SUSE, FreeBSD)
    - IP address is the public IP address of the machine, you cannot use private IP to connect.
    - Private key `privatekey.pem` is enough as AWS puts public key automatically to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - üí° When you first download key-pair file permission is 0644 which is to open -> private key can leak as it's accessible by others.
    - üìùFix with `chmod 0400 awsEc2.pem` -> only root user can see it.
  - On Linux / Mac we use SSH, on Windows we use PuTTy (on Windows 10 SSH can be used as well)
- **Configuring Windows machines**
  - **EC2 Launch** is PowerShell scripts that does makes the computer AWS-friendly

## Security Groups
  - **Inbound rules**
    - From other to the instance
    - All inbound rules are denied by default
    - You define protocol (e.g. TCP) & port range & source
      - **Source**
        - üìùAnother security group (type in Group ID)
        - An IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block
        - A single IPv4 or IPv6 address (e.g. anywhere: `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 and `::/0` for IPv6)
  - **Outbound rules**
    - From the instance to other
    - Open to everywhere by default
    - You define protocol (e.g. TCP) & port range & destination.
      - **Destination**
        - üìùAnother security group
        - An IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block
        - A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
        - An AWS service (i.e. prefix list ID)
- Can be attached to multiple instances
- An instance can have multiple security groups
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
  - ‚ùó You need to recreate security groups if you change region / VPC.
  - You can create a snapshot => Create AMI and use AMI to launch in other AZ or copy AMI to new region and launch there.

- üìùAny ***timeout errors*** means a misconfiguration of your security groups
- If your application gives "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
- ‚ùó You can only delete security group after you delete all EC2 instances associated with the security group.
- ‚ùóüìù You cannot block single IP/IP-range with Security Groups, you'll need NACL (Network Access Control Lists) for it.
  - Security groups can only "allow" services through a default deny
  
## EC2 User Data

- Enables to bootstrap instances using EC2 data script.
  - *bootstrapping* means launching commands when a machine starts
- Script is only run once at the instance first start
- For faster deployment without bootstrapping use **Golden AMI**s:
  1. Create a golden AMI with the static installation components already setup
  2. Use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time.
      - ü§ó Elastic Beanstalk is a good example for mixing golden AMIs and EC2 user data.

## EC2 Instance Launch Types

- **On demand instances**
  - Start whenever you want & stop without any long time commitment.
  - Pricing
    - Pay for what you use (billing per second, after the first minute)
- **Reserved instances**
  - **Standard Reserved instances**
    - Reserve an instance for 1 to 3 years
    - Enables you to modify Availability Zone, scope, network platform, and instance size (within the same instance type)
      - Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand
    - You can sell sell your unused instances on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace.
    - üí° Can be sold in Reserved Instance Marketplace
  - **Convertible Reserved Instances**
    - Convertible means you have option to change:
      - Instance family, instance type, platform, scope, and tenancy
      - Only if the creation of new instance is equal or greater value
    - Pricing: Up to 54& discount
    - üí° Workloads are likely to change
  - ***Scheduled Reserved Instances***
    - Launch within time window you reserve
    - üí° You know something will happen e.g. every week but only during one hour or one day.
- **Spot instances**
  - Cheapest (up to 90% discount compared to on demand) but risk of losing instance
    - Spot instance is charged per second.
    - If you get shut down in first hour you don't pay.
  - You bid a maximum price and get the instance as long as it's under the price
    - You lose the instance if you get outbid
      - Instances are reclaimed with a 2 minute notification warning when the spot price goes above your bid.
      - ***Persistence request*** allows instances to come back when the price drops to the right pricing.
    - Price varies based on offer and demand at times
  - **üìùSpot instance shut down priority**: The one who had longer time (e.g. 50 min) will be shut down faster than the shorter time (e.g. 5 min)
  - In the event of an interruption, you can set instances to be **terminated** or **hibernated**.
  - You may get insufficient capacity error
    - Stop all instances & start again to end up in a new hardware.
- ‚ùó 20 On-Demand & 20 Reserved & 20 Spot instances per region (soft limit)

### Tenancy

- ‚ùó [Cannot change tenancy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html#dedicated-howitworks) after launching instances when
  - From *default* to *dedicated* or *host*.
  - From *dedicated* or *host* to *default*.
  - üí° You only switch between dedicated instances i.e. from *host* to *dedicated* and from *host* to *dedicated*.
 
- **Dedicated instances**
  - Instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
    - You don't control your hardware.
    - May share hardware with other instances in same account
  - No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)
- **Dedicated Hosts**
  - Physical dedicated EC2 server for your use
  - Full control of EC2 instance placement
  - Visibility into the underlying sockets / physical cores of the hardware
    - You have direct access to the CPU
  - Allocated for your account for a 3 year period reservation
  - More expensive
  - You can allow instance auto-placement where untargeted EC2s will be launched in dedicated host(s).
  - Useful for
    - Complicated licenses such as BYOL - Bring Your Own License, or you pay based on CPU cores etc.
      - ‚ùó A Dedicated Host is required if you'd like to use your existing Windows Server licenses.
    - Regulatory & compliance needs.

## EC2 Instance Types

- üìù**Main types**

    | Type | Mnemonic | Category | Description | Use-cases |
    | ---- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- |
    | M | (M)ain / (M)edium | General purpose | Balance of compute, memory, network resources | General, mid-size databases, web apps |
    | C | (C)ompute |  Compute optimized | Advanced CPUs | Modeling, analytics, databases |
    | H | (H)DD | Storage optimized | Local HDD storage | Map reduce |
    | R | (R)am | Memory Optimized | More ram per $ | In-memory caching |
    | X | (X)treme | Memory Optimized | Terabytes of RAM and SSD | In-memory databases |
    | I | (I)ops | IO optimized | Local SSD storage, High IOPS | NoSQL databases |
    | G | (G)PU | GPU Graphics | GPUs with video encoders | 3D rendering |
    | P | (P)ictures | GPU Compute | GPUs with tensor cores | Machine learning |
    | F | (F)ield | Accelerated Computing | Field Programmable Gate Array, custom hardware accelerations | Genomics, financial analytics |
    | T | (T)iny / (T)urbo | Burstable, Shared CPUs, lowest cost | Web servers |

- **Burstable instances**
  - Good performance for a burst / short while e.g. spike and your CPU goes to 100%
  - Burst credits
    - Bursting consumes burst credits and low CPU gets you credits.
    - You get more credits when your CPU is low.
- T2 / T3 unlimited provides *unlimited burst* but you pay extra if you go over your credit balance.

## EC2 AMIs

- **Two virtualization types**
  - **HVM VM** - Hardware virtual machine
  - **PV VM** - Paravirtual virtual machines, only available for Linux
  - üí° HVM is recommended because same or or better performance than paravirtual guests.
    - ***Before***: Better storage & network in PV VM because of special I/O drivers.
    - ***Now***: PV drivers are available for HVM VM (instead of emulating hardware)
- **Custom AMIs**
  - Can be created from volumes or snapshots.
  - ‚ùó AMI are built for a specific AWS region
    - An AMI created for a region can only be seen in that region.
    - üìù Copying makes it available in different regions for e.g. disaster recovery.
- **AMI Storage**
  - S3 but you won't see them in the S3 console
  - By default, your AMIs are private and locked for your account / region.
    - You can make AMIs public in order to share with other accounts or sell in AMI Marketplace.

### Common tasks

- **Copying an AMI**
- AWS does not batch copy following, need manual work:
  - User-defined tags
  - Launch permissions
  - S3 bucket permissions
- **Create AMI from EC2**
  - Right click on EC2 -> Image -> Create Image
  - When it's done it appears on EC2 dashboard -> Images -> AMIs
  - You can right click and
    - *Copy* it to another region
    - *Deregister* it in order to remove it.
    - In *image permissions*:
      - Make it publicly available, or share it with other AWS account numbers.
      - Create volume permissions option allows others accessing AMI to make a copy of the AMI.
    - *Launch* a new EC2 based on it.
- üìù**Cross account / cross region AMI Copy**
  - Share AMI with another AWS account
    - Sharing an AMI does not affect the ownership of the AMI.
      - ‚ùó However if you copy an AMI that has been shared with your account, you are the owner of the target AMI in your account.
    - Flow:
        1. Right click on EC2 -> Image Permissions
        2. Keep it private & add account number.
        3. Select *Add "create volume permissions to snapshot* to allow other accounts to make a copy.
  - Ensure you have read permissions for AMI storage:
    - Associated EBS snapshot (for an Amazon EBS-backed AMI)
    - Associated S3 bucket (for an instance store-backed AMI)
  - ‚ùó You can't copy:
    - Encrypted AMI shared from another account
      - üí° Instead you can copy the snapshot (if it's shared with encryption key) and re-encrypt it & register as a new AMI you own.


## EC2 Placement Groups

- Use to control how EC2 instances will be placed within AWS infrastructure.
- ‚ùó Works only for certain types of instances
- ‚ùó You can't merge placement group
- ‚ùó Placement group must have unique name within AWS account.
- ‚ùó You can't move existing EC2 to placement group -> you can create AMI and launch new.
- üí° AWS recommends homogenous instances within placement groups e.g. using same instance types.
- ***Creation***
  - Console -> EC2 -> Placement Groups -> Create Placement Group -> Select a strategy
  - You can now launch new EC2 instances in the placement group.
- **Placement Group Strategies**
  - **Cluster**
    - Clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone
      - ‚ùó Cannot span multiple AZ
    - High performance, high risk
      - High network throughput, low-latency (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances)
      - Same rack & same AZ -> If the rack fails, all instances fails at the same time.
    - üí° Use cases
      - Big Data job that needs to complete fast
      - Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput.
  - **Spread**
    - Spreads instances across underlying hardware (‚ùó max 7 instances per group per AZ)
    - Can span across multi AZ.
    - Minimizes failure risks.
  - **Partition**
    - Spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ.
     - ‚ùó Up to 7 partitions per AZ
    - EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata
    - üí° Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka
