# DynamoDB

- Serverless, provisioned capacity, auto scaling, on demand capacity
- Can replace ElastiCache as a key/value store
  - Not sub millisecond (as ElasticSearch) performance but single digit (1-9 millisecond) performance.
- **Availability**
  - Multi AZ in 3 data centers by default
  - **Backup and Restore**: Point in time restore like RDS without performance impact
    - ❗ On restored table, you need to manually setup the following: ASG, IAM, CloudWatch metrics/alarm, tags, stream & TTL settings.
- Read & Writes are decoupled: you can provision read and write capacity units
- **Consistency**
  - Reads can be eventually consistent or strongly consistent
  - *(Optionally)* **Transactions** for writes
    - All or nothing type of operations
    - Coordinated Insert, Update & Delete across multiple tables
- Monitoring through CloudWatch
- ❗ Can only query on primary key, sort key or indexes
- 💡 Use cases:
  - Serverless applications development (small documents 100s KB)
  - Distributed serverless cache
- 💡 **Best Practices**
  - Keep item sizes small
  - If you are storing serial data in DynamoDB that will require actions based on data/time use separate tables for days, weeks, months
  - Store more frequently and less frequently accessed data in separate tables
    - Allows you to set appropriate provisioning levels independently for the tables
  - Store objects larger than 400KB in S3 and use pointers (S3 Object ID) in DynamoDB

## Security

- VPC Endpoints available to access DynamoDB without internet
  - VPC Endpoint = an endpoint network interface (ENI)
- Access fully controlled by IAM

## Scaling options

1. On-demand
    - Auto scales by Application Auto Scaling
      - **Scaling policy**
    - 2.5x more expensive than provisioned capacity (use with care!)
2. **Provisioned** RCU (read compute unit) & WCU (write compute unit)
    - They're decoupled can be increased / decreased individually
    - 1 RCU
      - 1 strongly consistent read of 4 KB per second
      - 2 eventually consistent read of 4 KB per second
    - 1 WCU = 1 write of 1 KB per second
    - Throughput can be exceeded temporarily using ***burst credit***
      - If burst credit are empty, you'll get `ProvisionedThroughputException`.
      
## DynamoDB Tables

- Each table has a **primary key** (must be decided at creation time)
  - Primary key values are unique identifiers across all partitions
- Each table have optional ***secondary indexes***.
  - Efficient access to data with attributes other than the primary key
  - **Global secondary index**
    - = Partition key (optionally + sort key) that can be different from those on the base table.
    - Index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions
    - No size limitations: Has its own provisioned throughput settings for read + write separate from table.
  - **Local secondary index**
    - = Partition key same as the base table + different sort key.
      - Sort key e.g. timestamp to query for time ranges.
    - Every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key value.
    - ❗ The total size of indexed items for any one partition key value can't exceed 10 GB.
  - 💡 All indexes requires unique partition key and a sort key
- Each item has ***attributes*** (can be added over time - can be null)
- ❗ Maximum size of an item is 400 KB

## DynamoDB Streams

- Changes in DynamoDB (Create, Update, Delete) can end up in a DynamoDB Stream
  - Generates changelogs for every operation
- Enables driven programming by integrating to **AWS Lambda**.
  - ❗ Must enable it to be able trigger a lambda.
- Can implement cross region replication using Streams
  - Streams enable DynamoDB to get a changelog and use that changelog to replicate data across regions
- Stream has 24 hours of data retention

## DAX: DynamoDB Accelerator

- Seamless cache for DynamoDB, no application rewrite
  - Application talks directly to DynamoDB accelerator with same connection string
- Writes goes through DAX to DynamoDB
- Micro second latency for cached reads & queries
- 📝 Solves Hot Key problem (too many reads)
- 5 minutes TTL for cache by default

## Global Tables

- Global service with region specific tables
- ❗ You must enable first **Dynamo Streams**
- **Global Tables** are multi region, fully replicated, high performance
- **Multi-Master**
  - Create multiple read-write instances per region
  - All changes are replicated to all tables.
  - Allows write-scaling.
- If data is updated from multiple regions
  - ***last writer wins*** to ensure eventual consistency
