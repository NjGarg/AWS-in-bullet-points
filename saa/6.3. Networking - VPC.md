# VPC

- ‚ùó You can have max 5 VPCs in a region - soft limit
  - ‚ùó Max CIDR per VPC is 5.
  - ‚ùó For each CIDR:
    - Min size is /28 = 16 IP addresses
    - Max size is /16 = 65536 IP addresses
- **Default VPC** in
  - All new accounts have a default VPC in each region.
  - It comes with
    - Subnet per AZ
    - Internet gateway
    - Network ACL: allows all inbound and outbound traffic
    - Main route table that routes VPC CIDR range to local and `0.0.0.0/0` to Internet gateway.
    - Security group denying inbound from internet, allowing outbound to internet.
  - Instances get public & private IPv4 + hostnames
    - In custom VPC = private IP + hostname, and public depending on settings
- **DNS Resolution in VPC**
  - `enableDnsSupport` (DNS Resolution setting)
    - Helps decide if DNS resolution is supported for the VPC
    - If true (default), queries the AWS DNS server at `169.254.169.253`
  - `enableDnsHostname` (DNS Hostname setting)
    - If True, assign public hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public IP
      - Private DNS is always assigned regardless true or false
    - False by default for newly created VPC, True by default for Default VPC
    - Won't do anything unless `enableDnsSupport=true`
  - üìù Private DNS + Route 53: enable DNS Resolution + DNS hostnames (VPC) DNS domains and their subdomains keeping the resources masked from the Internet.

### Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

- Like firewall which control traffic from and to subnets.
- Deployed into VPC
- NACLs are ***stateless*** filtering rules
  - Stateless because if an ingress traffic is allowed, the response is not automatically allowed unless explicitly allowed in the rule for the subnet.
- Applied at the subnet level and applies to every resource deployed to the subnet
  - A subnet can have only one NACL
  - Same NACL can be applied to multiple subnet
- ***NACL Rules***
  - Rules are numbered and evaluated in order
  - Starting with the lowest numbered rule
 - Default NACL allows everything outbound and everything in bound
  - ‚ùó Newly created NACL will deny everything
- **Ephemeral ports**
  - An ephemeral port is a short-lived transport protocol port for Internet Protocol (IP) communications.
  - Ephemeral ports are allocated automatically from a predefined range by the IP stack software.
  - Allows returning traffic to clients
  - To cover the different types of client that might initiate traffic to public-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024 - 65535 (NAT Gateway ports) to outbound connections.
    - You should deny malicious ports

### Security Groups

- ***stateful*** e.g. if inbound rule passes, outbound rule passes as well
- Applied at the EC2 instance level
  - More specific: Elastic Network Interface (ENI) level

## VPC Peering

- Connect two VPC, privately using AWS network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- ‚ùó Unsupported VPC Peering Configurations
  - Must not have overlapping CIDR
  - VPC Peering connection is not transitive
  - Edge to Edge Routing Through a Gateway or Private Connection
- You can do ***cross-account*** & ***cross-region*** VPC peering
- You must update route tables in each VPC's subnets to ensure instances can communicate,
- The accepter VPC must "accept" the peering connection,

## VPC Endpoints
- Allow you to connect to AWS Services using AWS network instead of the public www network.
- PrivateLink = VPC Endpoints
- Two types of endpoints:
  - **Interface**:
    - Provisions an ENI (Elastic Network Interface with private IP address) as an entry point
    - Must attach security group
    - Ensure that the attributes `Enable DNS hostnames` and `Enable DNS Support` in VPC are set to true.
  - **Gateway**:
    - S3 and DynamoDB only
    - In route table it provisions a target for internal S3/DynamoDB to the VPC endpoint automatically.
    - Ensure resources accessing S3 (e.g. EC2) has IAM role to the resource
## Flow Logs

- ![VPC flow logs](img/networking/vpc-flow-logs.png)
- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - Subnet Flow Logs
  - Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
  - Can log ACCEPT traffic, REJECT traffic or both.
- Data is sent to either S3 or CloudWatch Logs
  - üìù You can query VPC flow logs using ***Athena*** on S3 or ***CloudWatch Logs Insights***
- ‚ùó You cannot allow it in peered VPCs unless the peer is in your account.

## Connect & manage private instances

- **Bastion Host** (Jump Boxes)
  - Designed to withstand security attacks and usually hosts only a proxy server
  - Used to administer EC2 (SSH/RDP)
    - Does not replace NAT gateway/instance as they are not used for SSH/RDP but to provide internet traffic to private subnets.
  - üí° Small EC2 instances is enough as it does not require much processing power.
  - Bastion Host security group must be tightened
    - üìùüí° Make sure the bastion host only has port 22 traffic from the IP you need, not from the security groups of your instances

- **SSM Session Manager**
  - Systems Manager allows you to remotely execute commands on managed hosts without using a bastion host
    - Way to go in future and will replace bastion hosts
    - You don‚Äôt have to manage SSH keys.
  - Free & serverless AWS managed service
  - Requires an IAM policy that allows users or roles to execute commands remotely.
  - Agents require an IAM role and policy that allow them to invoke the Systems Manager service.
    - The Systems Manager agent is an open-source executable that runs on supported versions of Linux and Windows
  - Systems Manager immutably logs every executed command
