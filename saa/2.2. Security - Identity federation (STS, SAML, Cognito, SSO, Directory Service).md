# Identity federation & SSO

- Federation assumes a form of 3rd party authentication e.g. LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory (=~ SAML), SSO, Open ID, Cognito
  - Single Sign On
  - Open ID
  - Cognito

## AWS STS - Security Token Service

  - Generates tokens when assuming roles.
  - ***Cross Account Access*** that allows users from one AWS account access resources in another
    `AssumeRole` 
  - ***Federation (Active Directory)***
    - Uses SAML (Security Assertion markup language)
  - ***Federation with third party providers / Cognito***
    - Used mainly in web and mobile applications. Makes use of Facebook/Google/amazon etc. to federate them

## Federation

- STS is common service to create credentials after identity validation
  - Identity validation can be  done through SAML, Cognito or Custom Identity Broker application.

- Verify that the user is authenticated by your local identity system
- Call the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) AssumeRole or GetFederationToken API operations to obtain temporary security credentials for the user
- Call the AWS federation endpoint and supply the temporary security credentials to request a sign-in token
- Construct a URL for the console that includes the token
- Give the URL to the user or invoke the URL on the userâ€™s behalf


### SAML based federation

- To integrate Active Directory / ADFS with AWS (or any SAML 2.0)
- An **IdP** authenticates on on-prem store and then exchanges **SAML assertion** that has roles with STS to get a redirect URL with token.

### Custom Identity Broker Application

- Uses the STS API: ***AssumeRole or GetFederationToken***

- ðŸ’¡ Use only if identity provider is not compatible with SAML 2.0
- You have to program ***Identity Broker*** that must determine the appropriate IAM policy.

## AWS Cognito

- Managed identity broker for web identity federation
- **User pools**

- **Identity Pools**
    - User logs into federated identity provider & gets *third party authentication token*.
    - Send *third party authentication* token to Cognito
      - Cognito returns Cognito ID with temporary AWS credentials 

- ***Web Identity Federation*** is an alternative to using Cognito but AWS recommends against it.

## AWS Single Sign On (SSO)

- Integrated with Microsoft Active Directory
- Only helpful for Web Browser, SAML 2.0 enabled applications.
  - E.g. IdP (Identity Provider) initiated single sign on

## Cognito vs SSO

- Amazon Cognito
  - Customer-targeted IAM and user directory solution.
  - For customers/developers building B2C or B2B apps for their customers
- Amazon SSO
  - Focused on SSO for employees accessing AWS and business apps

## AWS Directory Service

- AWS managed Active Directory
  - ðŸ’¡ Choose to integrate with on-prem ID if you don't want to setup federation / SAML infrastructure for SSO

- **AD Connector**

  - Eliminates the need for directory synchronization and the cost and complexity of hosting a federation infrastructure.

- **Simple Active Directory**
